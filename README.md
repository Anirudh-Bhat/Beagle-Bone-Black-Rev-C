# Beagle-Bone-Black-Rev-C
Traffic signal control using image processing 
Microcontroller - "Beagle Bone BLack Rev C"
5 different modules i.e:
1.cam.py:to initialize the camera.
2.refimg.py: to capture refrence image.
3.image.py:to capture the image of every lane.
4.my_signal.py:to control the traffic signals.
5.step.py:to controll the stepper motor on which the camera was mounted.
and finally in the main.py all the modules are used to find the RELATIVE traffic density of every lane and the time slot and the priority for every lane is given based on the relative traffic density
